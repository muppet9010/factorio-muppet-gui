Next:
    - some sort of concurrent x messages for a given "context". not sure how it would be managed.
    - at present we tidy up gui element click global entries when gui is removed for all via timeout. However there is no tidy up if no timeout is used and all players have just closed the same GUI via the close button.


Future:
    - take the persistent message code for having messages to players when they join.
    - make a way to get the message history of "important" flagged messages to show so the player can review the messages again. New players joining will get all important messages shown.
    - Take messages for player joined as a mod setting json object.

    - add nested message support with types, i.e. titles, content types, etc. just map to inner styles.
