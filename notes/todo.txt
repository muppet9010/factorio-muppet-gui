Next:
    - some sort of concurrent x messages for a given "context". not sure how it would be managed.


Future:
    - take the persistent message code for having messages to players when they join.
    - make a way to get the message history of "important" flagged messages to show so the player can review the messages again. New players joining will get all important messages shown.
    - Take messages for player joined as a mod setting json object.

    - add nested message support with types, i.e. titles, content types, etc. just map to inner styles.
