Now:



Next:
    - add some larger text sizes, as the current ones are right for GUIs but not messages.
    - look at way via remote interfaces that existing text's can be removed by a name. For use with scripting chat integrations, i.e. add a timer that is then removed when the player dies. Will need to avoid duplicate entries being created with the same name.



Future:
    - some sort of concurrent x messages for a given "context". not sure how it would be managed.

    - take the persistent message code for having messages to players when they join.
    - make a way to get the message history of "important" flagged messages to show so the player can review the messages again. New players joining will get all important messages shown.
    - Take messages for player joined as a mod setting json object.

    - add nested message support with types, i.e. titles, content types, etc. just map to inner styles.
