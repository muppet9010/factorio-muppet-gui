Version: 20.0.4
Date: 2022-10-23
  Features:
    - Added remote interface to add Gui text in addition to the existing Factorio command.
    - Added optional `transparent`, `contentInnerLight`, `brightRed`, `brightGreen` and `brightYellow` background option. Defaults to main Factorio grey color.
    - Added optional close button color option to be either white or black. Defaults to white.
    - Added `aboveCenter` and `belowCenter` values for the `position` option. These are offsets from the center of the screen by about 1/3 screen height.
    - Added `timer` functionality and option group. Support counting up/down from a starting value, and displaying the number in a given max time unit. Display as either just seconds or minutes:seconds.
    - Added large text size of `huge`, `massive` and `gigantic`. Actual font sizes of all are in readme.
    - Added remote interface to remove a message. The add message remote interface returns the created messageId for use when removing it.
  Changes:
    - Custom colors renamed to be camel cased; only colors affected are `lightred` to `lightRed`, and `guiHeadingColor` to `guiHeadingColor`. The standard color names in the list remain all lower cased as they were before. `lightred` was in example text in readme previously.
    - Small text gets a smaller x close button so the GUI background isn't expanded just for it.
    - number options must be supplied as numbers, you can't provide them as strings any more. The other data types didn't do conversation before.
  Bugfixes:
  Info:
    - Mod tidy up - Mod globals related to close buttons will remove themselves when finished with. Avoids the global list getting infinitely long which could in theory cause slowness or save file size growth over millennium. Makes any future debugging easier.
    - Any old Message GUI's are removed as part of upgrading to this version. This is as a lot of back end state changes were made and it would be a nightmare to try and create the new data structure for these old entries. Just wait to update the mod when the old message GUIs are gone if they are critical to you.
